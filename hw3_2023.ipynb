    "The Classical Gram-Schmidt method orthogonalizes the columns of the matrix one by one. It starts with the first column and orthogonalizes the remaining columns with respect to it.\n",
    "The Modified Gram-Schmidt method works similarly, but instead of orthogonalizing the remaining columns with respect to the current column, it orthogonalizes all remaining columns with respect to all previous columns. This decreases the loss of orthogonality with respect to the classical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Householder QR method is a entirely different method alltogether. It performs so-called Householder reflections and applied them to transform the matrix to an upper triagular matrix. Householder reflections are orthogonal transformations that zero out all values below a certain point in a vector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences in accuracy\n",
    "The main way the accuracy between these methods could differ is the accumulation of rounding errors. Since the Classical Gram-Schmidt method orthogonalizes the columns one by one with respect to the first one, each new calculation will add to the rounding error that most likely appeared during the calculation of the first column. The Modified Gram-Schmidt method has a higher accuracy, because it calculates the new column based on the previous column, which will lessen the accumulated errors, but it will not remove it completely. Householder QR works by directly zeroing out entries below the main diagonal and does not rely on previous calculatios. Therefore, it also does not propagate previous errors. The only error is floating point."
