Furthermore, the memory occupation for the LU decomposition is significantly lower for the sparse matrix. Moreover, the memory occupation for the sparse matrix does, in this case, not change whether its a 100x100 matrix or 1000x1000, whereas there is a very big change in memory occupation in the dense matrix.
